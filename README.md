Hey, Andrew. Please don't close the door. Just let me talk and I'll leave. I promise. I.. I'm scared. And- and your words have been repeating in my mind without end. I stay in my bed for hours after I wake up. I barely eat. I've been daydreaming in my mind until I can't tell what's real and what isn't... I'm trying to say that I'm broken.
